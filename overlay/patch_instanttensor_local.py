"""InstantTensor: rank-local Direct I/O instead of NCCL-sharded all-gather.

With TP>1, vLLM's instanttensor_weights_iterator passes the world process
group, so each rank reads a slice and the ranks all-gather over NCCL. On the
2x GB10 cluster that path left ~1.5-2 GiB of NCCL transport buffers resident
for the life of the communicator (boots peaked at 120.2-120.9 GiB used vs
119.3-119.5 with the mmap loader; both InstantTensor boots tripped the
memory watchdog, 2026-09-04). A standalone load with no process group
returned every byte after close. Env MIMO26_IT_LOCAL_READS=1 (default) makes
each node read the full checkpoint from its own NVMe: no NCCL, ~35-60 s for
164 GB vs 259 s for the mmap loader. Idempotent; fails closed on drift.
