"""Release caching-allocator slack after each weight-load pass.

InstantTensor yields device-resident tensors, so every weight passes through
the CUDA caching allocator as a transient (clone, then a TP narrow().contiguous()
compaction) before being copied into its parameter. Over 164 GB of churn the
allocator keeps ~2.4 GiB of freed-but-mapped segments (measured: allocated
82,387 MiB vs reserved 84,818 MiB right after load, 2026-09-04); on the 121 GiB
unified-memory Sparks that slack is exactly the margin graph capture needs,
and both InstantTensor boots tripped the memory watchdog. The mmap loader
copies CPU->param and never creates the transients. gc + empty_cache after
load_weights returns the slack to the OS; harmless for any loader.
Idempotent; fails closed on anchor drift.
